                <p>The basic form of the flashlight seems obvious and intuitive today, but designers of early portable electric lights were heavily influenced by old technology. Many of their devices looked like candlesticks, candleholders, or lanterns. Owen T. Bugg, Jr., almost got it right in 1898 with his “portable electric lamp,” marketed as the O. T. Bugg Friendly Beacon Electric Candle. The cylindrical battery case remained upright, like a candle, but Bugg mounted the lamp on the side, so the device looked something like a beer stein with a headlight.The basic form of the flashlight seems obvious and intuitive today, but designers of early portable electric lights were heavily influenced by old technology.

She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.  Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>
                <p>Far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

                <p>To the casual observer, a discussion of “flashlight technology” seems like gilding the lily. You push a button, a light comes on; you push it again, the light goes off. Not very technical. Forty years ago, that would have been the extent of the discussion. Today, our flashlights use a wide variety of power sources and types of illumination, and generally cost a lot more than the $1.98 one would pay for a two-cell light at the hardware store</p>
